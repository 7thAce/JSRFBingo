# JSRF Bingo Repository

JSRF Bingo's overlay, connection, and processing system.
Right now, this is one bundle called jsrf-bingo-s-8, which leads to the idea of other jsrf bingo extensions, but the auto generated git put it here, so here we are.
Goals:
- [10%] Redo the dashboard. *Everything* in normal operations should be doable from the dashboard. 
- [5%] Convert as much stuff to SVG as possible to control it through JS.
- [0%] Rewrite bingo.js (the display page). It's awful.
- [0%] Centralize everything into a server that fully understands the gamestate and sends out events through websockets.
- Enable variations such as pinball to stand alone in either their own bundles or own files.
